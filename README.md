# Migrate DGA Items

### What this mod does:
* Tries to migrate Dynamic Game Assets (DGA) items in saves from before 1.6 to their new 1.6 versions IF a) the mod's 1.6 version is installed and b) the naming scheme is sufficiently similar
* If that fails, converts them to error items with the name reflecting what they used to be. You can use a mod like Lookup Anything to go in and look at this to get some clues about what mods they came from and therefore how to replace them manually. 

### What this mod does NOT do:
* Convert DGA furniture mods to use 1.6 Content Patcher format

### Why won't you convert DGA furniture mods to 1.6 format?
* DGA allowed mods to add very complex behavior to their furniture
* DGA allowed a very flexible tilesheet layout
* Converting very complex mods with high variability is very painful, if not impossible to do automatically
If your furniture mods were originally Custom Furniture (CF) format, those are much easier to convert to 1.6 CP format.
